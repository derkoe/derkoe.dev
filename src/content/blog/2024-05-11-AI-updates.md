## GPT-4o image generation

Two weeks ago OpenAI launched their new image gen model and it is actually great! Everybody is creating Ghibli-style avatars and action figures for their profiles. The important thing is that this model can create really realistic images with correct text ðŸŽ‰ 

Here is one that I have created with "Generate an image of a 2021 Skoda Octavia Combi in color dark blue with transparent background":

Currently, it is only available in ChatGPT - the API should follow in a few weeks.

## AI 2027 - https://ai-2027.com/
The AI Futures Project published a scenario (I would call it an essay) on the future of AI from now - 2030. I must say their predictions do not look quite good for humans. The main author is well known to predict the AI future very well and they even offer bounties for better future predictions. There is also a summary: https://ai-2027.com/summary
 
If you want to predict the AI future yourself you can use this handy tool: https://swantescholz.github.io/aifutures/v4/v4.html
 
## AI Tools â€“ What about data protection?
Great overview of the data protection implications of the different AI models and usages by Vischer AG:
[Part 25: AI Tools â€“ What about data protection? - VISCHER](https://www.vischer.com/en/knowledge/blog/part-25-ai-tools-what-about-data-protection/)
Azure OpenAI and Google Gemini are the best options in the field of data protection (when using hosted models).
 
## Meta AI launched Llama 4
It was launched on a Saturday and it seems like the first testers were not really impressed. It seems to perform good in benchmarks but not that good in real life (seems they did some tricks - see LMArena tightens rules after Llama 4 incident | The Times Of Innovations)
