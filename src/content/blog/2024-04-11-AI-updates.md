## GPT-4o Image Generation

Two weeks ago, OpenAI launched their new image generation model, and it is truly impressive! Everyone is creating Ghibli-style avatars and action figures for their profiles. The standout feature of this model is its ability to generate highly realistic images with accurate text ðŸŽ‰.

Here is an example I created with the prompt:  
*"Generate an image of a 2021 Skoda Octavia Combi in dark blue with a transparent background"*:

![Skoda Octavia Combi](/skoda-octavia.png "Generated image of a 2021 Skoda Octavia Combi")

Currently, it is only available in ChatGPT, but the API is expected to follow in a few weeks.

## AI 2027 - A Scenario of AI's Future

The AI Futures Project has published a scenario (or essay) on the future of AI from now until 2030. The main author is well known to [predict the AI future very well](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like) and the project even offer bounties for better future predictions.

## AI Tools â€“ What About Data Protection?

Vischer AG has provided a great overview of the data protection implications of various AI models and their usage:
[Part 25: AI Tools â€“ What About Data Protection?](https://www.vischer.com/en/knowledge/blog/part-25-ai-tools-what-about-data-protection/)

Azure OpenAI and Google Gemini stand out as the best options in terms of data protection (when using hosted models).

## Meta AI Launched Llama 4

Meta AI launched Llama 4 on a Saturday ðŸ¤”. It is a multimodal model that can handle text, images and video. The initial feedback from testers has been underwhelming. While it performs well in benchmarks, its real-world performance seems to fall short. There are claims of "tricks" being used, as highlighted in the article:  
[LMArena Tightens Rules After Llama 4 Incident](https://timesofinnovation.com/ai-regulation/lmarena-tightens-rules-after-llama-4-incident/). Let's see what the future of this model family holds.
